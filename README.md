# Brats2020_brain_tumor_segmentation
#Overview                                  

This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project focused on brain tumor segmentation using the BRATS 2020 dataset. 

The project leverages a 3D U-Net model to accurately delineate tumor regions within multi-modal MRI scans.

#Key Features

1.3D U-Net Model:Implemented a state-of-the-art 3D U-Net architecture, renowned for its excellence in volumetric medical image segmentation.

2.Data Preprocessing:Proficiently prepared and preprocessed multi-modal MRI scans from the BRATS 2020 dataset to ensure data consistency and quality.

3.Performance Analysis:Using Mean Iou Metrics we determine the Accuary between predicted mask and actual mask.
